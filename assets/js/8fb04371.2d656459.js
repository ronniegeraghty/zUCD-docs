The UCD process will handle generating a list of CICS specific Load Modules in the incremental version we are deploying, using this list to check which of the Load Modules have been loaded into CICS already then generating a list of these already loaded Load Modules, then running NEWCOPYs on the new version on these already loaded Load Modules.

The incremental version of this application was built using Dependency Based Build (DBB) and the zAppBuild Framework. This information is important because during the DBB build the zAppBuild Framework assigns a property know as the DeployType to each artifact produced. For example, a program that uses CICS and Db2 would produce a DBRM and a CICS Load Module. The zAppBuild Framework would assign the DBRM artifact a Deploy Type of DBRM and the CICS Load Module artifact a Deploy Type of LOAD. I then use this Deploy Type property in the UCD process to generate lists of specific artifact types.
